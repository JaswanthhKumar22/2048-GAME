## 🎯 How to Play

1. Use **Arrow Keys** (↑ ↓ ← →) or **WASD** to slide all tiles in a direction
2. When two tiles with the **same number** collide, they **merge into one** (e.g. 2 + 2 = 4)
3. After every move, a new tile (2 or 4) appears randomly on the board
4. Reach the **2048** tile to win! Or keep going for an even higher score
5. The game ends when no more moves are possible

**On mobile:** Swipe in any direction on the game board.

| **`storage.js`** | Read/write best score to `localStorage` |
| **`game-logic.js`** | Pure functions for sliding rows, merging tiles, checking win/loss — zero DOM dependency |
| **`board.js`** | Manages the 2D grid array, tracks empty cells, spawns random tiles |
| **`ui.js`** | Creates and positions tile DOM elements, manages overlays and score display |
| **`app.js`** | Coordinates everything — handles input events, runs the game loop, manages state |

## 🎨 Design Highlights

- **Color Palette** — Dark navy background (`#0f0f1a`) with purple (`#7c5cfc`) and pink (`#ec4899`) accents
- **Tile Progression** — Colors shift from cool dark purples (2, 4) → warm oranges (8–64) → golden yellows (128–2048) → vibrant gradient (super tiles)
- **Glassmorphism** — Score boxes use `backdrop-filter: blur()` with semi-transparent backgrounds
- **Micro-animations** — Score "+N" floats upward and fades, tiles pop on merge, new tiles scale in
- **2048 Glow** — The 2048 tile has a golden box-shadow glow effect
